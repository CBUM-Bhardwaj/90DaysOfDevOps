## 📶 1. OSI & TCP/IP Models

### 🎯 Goal  
Understand and internalize the layered network architecture.

| 🧱 Layer (OSI / TCP‑IP)        | 🔍 Description                      | 🌍 Real‑World Examples                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Application / Application     | Interface for apps (web, mail…)     | HTTP (web browsers), SMTP (email clients)        |
| Presentation / —              | Data formatting, encryption         | TLS encryption, base64 encoding                  |
| Session / —                   | Manages sessions, dialogues         | SSH session, database connections                |
| Transport / Transport         | End‑to‑end delivery, reliability     | TCP (HTTP), UDP (DNS, VoIP)                      |
| Network / Internet            | Logical addressing and routing      | IP, ICMP (ping), IP routing                      |
| Data Link / Link              | Physical addressing, frames         | Ethernet, ARP                                    |
| Physical / —                  | Raw bit transfer via hardware       | Cables, switches, Wi‑Fi radio waves              |

✅ **Task:** Added real‑world analogies to internalize each layer.
